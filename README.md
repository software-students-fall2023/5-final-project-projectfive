## Product Vision Statement

"Time Capsule Planner" is a web platform for sending time-locked letters and to-do lists to one's future self, fostering goal-setting, self-reflection, and personal growth.

## User Requirements

1. As a user, I want to create and manage an account, so that I can have a personalized and secure space for my letters and to-do lists.
2. As a user, I want the option to share my achieved goals on public community, so that I can share my progress and successes with others.
3. As a user, I want to have some default options for time length, so that I can only click on the options to set time length to save time.
4. As a user, I want to customize the timelength to lock the letter, so that it will be more flexible for me to plan.
5. As a user, I want to save my plan as scratch, so that I can edit it before I confirm it's complete.
6. As a user, I want my letters and to-do lists to remain securely locked until the set time after I complete them, so that I can enjoy the surprise and authenticity of my past thoughts and goals.
7. As a user, I want to be notified when my time-locked content is available, so that I can revisit my past goals and reflections on time.
